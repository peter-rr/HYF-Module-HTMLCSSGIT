            <p>
              Ever since I was a little kid, technology and music have been my
              passions. I still remember recording my first mixtapes on cassette
              or playing all the latest arcades in town. So I decided to study
              some technical degree and I've been gravitating toward testing and
              quality assurance positions for some years. But I kind of just
              felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something
              different.

              And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the
              instant I started solving my first CSS challenges. Since then
              I can't get enough. Web development icorporates creativity and
              problem solving, something that I was missing so much before. Now
              that I'm taking the HackYourFuture course I truly know there is
              certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet
              more to build.
